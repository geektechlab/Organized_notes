GFG videos focus on C++. Practice it using C. For example, how to interchange between ASCII and hax value of char ?

- Array decay: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-array-decay-in-c-how-can-it-be-prevented/, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-decay-in-c/
- Strings in C ( Very very important ): https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/dsa-4/track/DSASP-Strings/video/MTQzNTU%3D ( https://stackoverflow.com/a/3131362, https://github.com/Shivanimundra/my_string.h/blob/master/strcpy.c, https://github.com/Shivanimundra/my_string.h/blob/master/strncpy.c )
- Leftmost repeating character: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/dsa-4/track/DSASP-Strings/video/MTYxMg%3D%3D
- Check for anagram: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/dsa-4/track/DSASP-Strings/article/Nzc2OQ%3D%3D ( Initialize two array of 256 eleents ( char can have 256 possibilities), and increment char positions as per string elemts and then check both arrays have same counts)
- Reverse words in given string setence: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/dsa-4/track/DSASP-Strings/article/Nzc2OA%3D%3D ( just reversing will reverse whole array with individual words reversed, so first reverse each words then reverse entire array)
- Find if substring is present: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/dsa-4/track/DSASP-Strings/problem/implement-strstr ( at each index run loop size of substring and check if part of original string matches )
