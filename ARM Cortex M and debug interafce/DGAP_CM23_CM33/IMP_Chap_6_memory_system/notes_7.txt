Many microcontrollers have a boot ROM/memory which contains a small program called boot loader, which is provided by MCU vendors. The boot loader executes before the user application, which is stored in the flash memory, starts. The boot loader provides various boot options and might include a flash programming utility. Besides, the boot loader program might also be used for setting configuration data, including:
• factory calibration data for internal clock sources, and
• calibration data for internal voltage references.

With security becoming an important requirement in embedded systems, the boot loader program may also provide:
• Secure boot feature (The ability to validate program images before starting the application)
• Secure firmware updates
• Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) for security management
Note: Some microcontroller designs do not allow the boot loader to be modified or erased by software developers.

on the Cortex-M33 processor’s interface, an additional APB-based Private Peripheral Bus (PPB). This is for connecting debug components to the processor and is not to be used for general peripherals.
- The PPB is privileged access only
- Only 32-bit access is supported
Please note, the PPB is little-endian only and cannot be accessed by other bus masters in the system (only software running on the processor and the debugger connected to the processor can access this bus). In systems with multiple bus masters that have, for example, DMA and USB controllers, the chip designer must ensure that the bus design can cope with the data bandwidth requirements of the applications. To enable a higher bus bandwidth, several techniques are commonly used and these are:
• Having a multilayer AHB design (also known as bus matrix)
• Having multiple banks of SRAM to allow concurrent SRAM access
For example, a Cortex-M33 processor system that contains DMA and USB controllers, both of which could be running concurrently, a system design like the one in Fig. 6.13 could be used to provide sufficient data bandwidth. This arrangement uses several bus arbiters to allow multiple bus masters to access different bus slaves at the same time. Combined with multiple banks of SRAM, the processor, DMA controller, nd USB controller can all access different SRAM at the same time and, by so doing, provide high data throughputs.
