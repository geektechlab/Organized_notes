Big endian is known as network byte order.

Little endian is known as host byte order.

Endianess infuences only on byte level, not on bit level.

Program to find machine endianess type:
int find_end_type()
{
	uint32_t a=1;
	char ist_byte = *((char *)&a);
	if(ist_byte==0)
	{
		print(big endian);
	}
	else if(ist_byte==1)
	{
		print(little endian);
	}
}
