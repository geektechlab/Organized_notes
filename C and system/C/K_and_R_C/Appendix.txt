Lines that end with the backslash character \ are folded by deleting the backslash and the 
following newline character. This occurs before division into tokens.

#define tempfile(dir) #dir "%s" 
the macro call tempfile(/usr/tmp) yields 
 "/usr/tmp" "%s"

#define cat(x, y) x ## y 
the call cat(var, 123) yields var123.
