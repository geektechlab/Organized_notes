int a;

int *p =&a;

int **d =&p;

we can't assign d = &a, it should take only &p, because it is double pointer.

d will hold address of p. p will hold address of a.

p+1 will be incremented by 4 because it hold int type value of a irrespective of machine size.

d+1 will be incremented by 4 on 32-bit machine because it holds reference of p pointer which is keeping address of a. To maintain address of a we need 4 bytes in 32-bit machine.

d+1 will be incremented by 8 on 64-bit machine because it holds reference of p pointer which is keeping address of a. To maintain address of a we need 8 bytes in 64-bit machine.

Sizeof pointer is dependent on machine types. sizeof(p) = &p+1 -&p
