char *c = " Hello" /* stores hello as constant and may store in flash so we can't change */

char c[20]="Hello" /* stores hello in stack, and using pointer to string we can modify */

char c[20]="Hello";
c[1]='C'; /* HCllo */
//c="D"; /* error: assignment to expression with array type */
*(c+3)='f'; /* HClfo */

char *c="Hello";
c[1]='C'; /* this is undefined */

just in case, while passing char array/string we can take arg as ( const char *c ) so that we can access elements but not modify.
