charater array should have last element as \0 ( null terminator ).

strlen(pointer to first elemet of character array) gives size of char array ( string ) excluding \0.

int a[5]="abcd";
using \0 printf("%s",a), it finds end of string.

int a[5]={'a','b','c','d'}; /* this will fail */
int a[5]={'a','b','c','d','\0'}; /* this will pass */

previous array pointer concept are same as in strings.

strlen traverses using pointer to string/starting pointer to char array and loops till \0. Using \0 we can avoid passing size of array to func arg.
