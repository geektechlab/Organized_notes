In IDAU, each are like code, SRAM, device etc. can be devided in NS and S. So all parts will have both NS nad S parts. It is not prorammable and defined by chip designer at hardware.

Any peripheral registers are mapped at 2 addresses, S and NS. NS registers can be accessed by S and NS. But S registers can be accessed by S only. Accessing S registers from NS will result in secure fault.

Since IDAU is hardcoded, SAU gives facility to modify S/NS/NSC states.
