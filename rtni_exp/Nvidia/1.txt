memcpy implementation such that all corner cases, src and dest overlap. I was incrementing pointers by adding some numbers but I could just do arr[i] or *(arr+i)

RGB(R,G,B), create macro to all 8 bit wide numbers and compress those into one 32 bit single number each having member field having 8 bytes.

use of function pointers
bit fields
structure padding
dynamic and static linking
