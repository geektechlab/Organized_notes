- I2C data GPIO pin config to init
- RTOS thread switching which registers are pushed and AAPCS register stacking and unstacking, also SVC use, Systick and PendSV usage
- Character replacement didn't take NULL terminator into account https://onlinegdb.com/MiLonhJNH, used bubble sort but could optimize, use *c by malloc, check NULL, only C[] works not C[5] also
- BSP, what all memories are there and how can be used
- What is startup file what contents are there in apart from Reset handler
- RTOS difference between bin semaphore, counting semaphore, mutex ( forgot diff between counting and binary )
- RTOS communication between tasks ( Queue but use of task notifications and event groups )

- Intro could be optimized ( just spoke college and company projects )
