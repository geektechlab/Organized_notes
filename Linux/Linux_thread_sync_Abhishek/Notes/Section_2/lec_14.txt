now let us try to understand what exactly parallelism is. Parallelism simply means that doing two or more different tasks in parallel that is at the same time.

So let us extend the same example. So consider this time you have three well-diggers assigned a task to dig the respective 100ft deep Well. But the only difference is that that each one of them now have their own personal well drilling tool right now, that every person has its own personal well drilling tool. It means that all the three can take the well in parallel. And there is no need for anybody to take rest until he completes the work. So it simply means that all of the three are doing the work in parallel. So the work of all the three well diggers is in progression as well as they are doing the work very fast.

So in parallelism, all the three well diggers will be able to complete the work in approximately three by three times where t is the total time taken by all the three well diggers when they were digging the well in a concurrent fashion. So here because we have allocated more resources to the Well-digger here, And because they have more hardware resources, therefore they are able to work independently, they are able to work without blocking each other. Because of more hardware resources, no well-digger is ever dependent on other well-digger and they can do their respective work in parallel. So it simply means that the total effective time taken to complete the work in parallelism is a way less than the time taken to complete the same amount of work in a concurrent manner. So the point to be noted here is that that the three well-diggers are able to do their work in parallel because they were provided with more hardware resources.
