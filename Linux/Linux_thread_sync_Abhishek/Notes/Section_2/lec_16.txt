now let us try to compare the Well-digging analogy that we discussed in the previous lecture videos with the actual Multithreading environment. So here we have four entities, the workers resources transaction and the amount of work to accomplish,

So as per the analogy, the workers are nothing, but they are the well-diggers, the peoples who were responsible to dig the wells, whereas in multithreaded environment the workers are nothing but they are threads. We create thread to do some piece of work. So thread is a worker in multi threading environment. Now when it comes to the resources, the resource that is used in the analogy was the digging tool. Whereas in multi threading environment the threads needs CPU memory and other hardware resources to accomplish or progress on their work.

Then when it comes to the transition in the Well-digging analogy, there was a transition from one well digger to another in the concurrency case. In the multithreading environment, the same transition is referred to as context switching. One thread is taken off the CPU and the other thread is assigned the CPU to accomplish its task. Right. So there is a transition from one thread to another when context switching happens. And finally, there was some finite amount of work to accomplish in the Well-digging analogy, that finite amount of work was to dig 100ft well, whereas in multithreading environment, each thread has some work to do. So work to be done by each thread Is the work to be accomplished by that particular thread.
