     * - Executing low priority, background, or continuous processing functionality.
     * - Measuring the amount of spare processing capacity. (The idle task will run only when all
     * higher priority application tasks have no work to perform; so measuring the amount
     * of processing time allocated to the idle task provides a clear indication of how much
     * processing time is spare.)
     * - Placing the processor into a low power mode, providing an easy and automatic method of
     * saving power whenever there is no application processing to be performed (although the power
     * saving that can be achieved using this method is less than can be achieved by using the
     * tick-less idle mode described in Chapter 10, Low Power Support). How RTOS ensures task delay
     * when idle task goes into sleep/deep sleep ? how it manages to wakeup / by systick
     * interrupt ?

     * - An Idle task hook function must never attempt to block or suspend. Note: Blocking the idle

     * - If the application makes use of the vTaskDelete() API function, then the Idle task hook must
     * always return to its caller within a reasonable time period. This is because the Idle task is
     * responsible for cleaning up kernel resources after a task has been deleted. If the idle task
