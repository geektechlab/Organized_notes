To decide whether sleep or deep sleep mode should be used when entering sleep, one of
the bit-fields called SLEEPDEEP would need to be programmed by software. SLEEPDEEP is
bit 2 in the System Control Register (SCR). The SCR is a memory-mapped register located in
address 0xE000ED10

Information on the SCR bit fields is listed in Table 10.2. Just like most other registers in the
System Control Block (SCB), the SCR can only be accessed in a privileged state.
The SLEEPDEEP bit (bit 2) can be set to enable the Deep Sleep mode. When TrustZone is
implemented, the access of this bit can be controlled by Secure privileged software using
SLEEPDEEPS bit (bit 3; this is a new bit field introduced in Armv8-M).
When TrustZone is implemented, Secure privileged software is also able to access the Nonsecure privileged view of this register using SCB_NS->SCB (address 0xE002ED10).

Cortex-M processors provide two instructions for entering sleep modes (Table 10.3). Both WFI sleep and WFE sleep can be woken up by interrupt requests. This depends on the
priority of the interrupt, the current priority level, and the interrupt mask settings
(Section 10.3.4).
WFE sleep can be woken up by events. Event sources include:
- An exception entrance and exit.
- A SEVONPEND event: When the SEV-On-Pend feature is enabled (bit 4 of the System
Control Register), then the event register is set when an interrupt pending status is changed
from 0 to 1.
- The assertion of an external event signal (an RXEV input on the processor). This indicates an
event from on-chip hardware has occurred. The event signal can be a single cycle pulse and
the connection of this signal is device-specific.
- The execution of a SEV (Send Event) instruction.
- A debug event (e.g., a halting request).
The processor can be woken up from WFE sleep by either a current or past event. If the
internal event register has been set, this indicates an event has been received since the last
WFE execution or sleep. When this happens, the execution of WFE does not enter sleep (it
may, potentially, only momentarily cause the processor to enter sleep mode and, if it does,
will then immediately wake up). Inside the processor, there is a single bit event register which
indicates whether an event has previously occurred. This event register is set by the aforementioned event sources and is cleared by the execution of a WFE instruction.
Similar to WFE sleep, during WFI sleep the processor can be woken up by an interrupt
request if the interrupt has a higher priority than the processor’s current priority level.
The processor’s current priority level is based on one of the following:
• the priority level of the running exception service, or
• the priority level of whichever active interrupt masking register (such as BASEPRI) has
been set.
These two priority levels are compared by the processor’s hardware and the one with the
higher priority level is used as the processor’s current priority level. The chosen level is then
compared against the priority level of a new incoming interrupt and will wake the processor
up if the interrupt request has a higher priority.

Alternatively, if the new incoming interrupt has the same or a lower priority than the processor’s current priority level, and if the SEV-on-pend feature is enabled, this is treated as an
event and will wake the processor up from WFE sleep.

The Sleep-on-Exit feature is very useful for interrupt-driven applications where all operations (apart from the initialization) are carried out using interrupt handlers. This is a programmable feature and can be enabled or disabled using bit 1 of the System Control
Register (SCR—see Section 10.2.3). When enabled, the Cortex®-M processor automatically enters sleep mode (with WFI behavior) when exiting from an exception handler and when
returning to Thread mode (i.e., when no other exception request is waiting to be processed).
For example, a program utilizing the Sleep-on-Exit feature might have a program flow as
shown in Fig. 10.2.
The activities of the program running in the system shown in Fig. 10.2 are shown in
Fig. 10.3. Unlike normal interrupt handling sequences, the stacking and unstacking processes
during Sleep-on-Exit are reduced to save power in the processor and its memories. However,
the first occurrence of the interrupt, as shown in Fig. 10.3, would still require a full stacking
operation.
Please note, the “loop” in Fig. 10.2 is required because the processor could still be woken up
by debug requests when a debugger is attached.

Important: The Sleep-On-Exit feature should not be enabled until the end of the initialization stage. Otherwise, if an interrupt event happens during the initialization stage, and if the
Sleep-on-Exit feature was already enabled, the processor will enter sleep mode even though
the initialization stage had not finished.

One of the programmable control bits in the System Control Register (SCR) is the
SEVONPEND. This feature is used with the WFE sleep operation. When this bit is set to 1,
any new incoming interrupt that sets the interrupt pending status is treated as a wakeup
event, and wakes up the processor from WFE sleep mode, regardless of:
• Whether or not the interrupt is enabled in the NVIC
• Whether the priority of the new interrupt has a higher priority than the current priority
level
If the pending status of the interrupt was already set to 1 before entering sleep, a new interrupt request will not trigger a SEV-on-pend event and will not wake up the processor.

In Cortex-M23 and Cortex-M33 processors with TrustZone implemented, the Non-secure
software can, as in previous generations of Cortex-M processors, enter sleep or deep sleep
modes using WFI, WFE or Sleep-on-Exit. However, Secure software can, optionally, prohibit
Non-secure software from altering the sleep setting (i.e., SLEEPDEEP, bit 2 in SCB->SCR) by
setting SLEEPDEEPS, bit 3 in SCB->SCR. Although SLEEPDEEP cannot be changed by the
Non-secure software when the SLEEPDEEPS bit is set, SLEEPDEEP can be changed by
way of a Secure API provided by the Secure firmware. This mechanism allows the Non-secure
software to access the power management features and, hence change SLEEPDEEP.
The use of Secure APIs for accessing power management features is essential in some
TrustZone enabled microcontroller systems. These systems would likely have additional
device-specific power management control registers, but setting these registers incorrectly
could affect the integrity of the system’s security. Because of this, access to those registers
must be protected by the system’s security permission control. By providing power management APIs in the Secure firmware, application software running in the Non-secure world can
utilize the system’s low power features and can still protect the security of the device.
