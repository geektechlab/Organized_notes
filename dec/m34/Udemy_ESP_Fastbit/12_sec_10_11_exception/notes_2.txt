Exception can be you know anything which disturbs the normal operation of the program by changing the operational mode of the processor.
In ARM Cortex M processor, there are 2 types of exceptions.2 major types of exceptions.
1) system exceptions.
2) interrupts.

System exceptions are generated by the processor itself and it's local to the processor. Where as interrupts come from the external world to the processor. So, collectively interrupts plus system exceptions we call it as you know exceptions.

So, whenever I use the term the exception it can be interrupt or it can be a locally generated system exception inside the processor core. And you already know that, a whenever the processor core meets with an exception it changes the operational mode to "Handler mode". So, any entity which has the capacity to change the mode of the processor to handler mode than it is an exception. 

There are in total 15 system exceptions supported by the Cortex M processors. So, 15 different system exceptions and 240 interrupts. So, in total we can say that, Cortex M processors support 255 exceptions ( 240 + 15 = 255 ) 240 interrupts and 15 system exceptions.
