int a=5;

int *p = &a;

and

int *p;
p = &a;

are same.

suppose p is 37282002 means pointing to location at 0x37282002 in memory.
p+1 will be 0x37282006 beacuse p is int type and it takes 4 bytes to represent int variable. So p will advance to 4 bytes.
p+2 will be 0x372820a0

*(p+0) and *p will be 5
*(p+1) will be some garbage value because it is not yet initialized.
