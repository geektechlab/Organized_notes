each byte of memory has an address.

int a; gets allocated on memory and how much bytes gets allocated depends on compiler and architecture of machine.

typically, int is 4 bytes, so it has 4 byte addresseable memory.

int a;
to point to this we need int *b;
only int * beacuse it tells compiler that memory pointed by b is for int and read upto 4 bytes. Other pointer type may not tell correctly.

b=&a;
a=5;
b ->205
&a ->205
*b ->5
*b = 8
a ->8
